        <div class="font">A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust,
            and dark
            matter. The word is derived from the Greek galaxias, literally 'milky', a reference to the
            Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred
            million stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center
            of mass.</div>

        <h5 class="heading"> THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY</h5>

        <p class="font">The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda
            Nebula, is a barred spiral galaxy with diameter of about 220,000 ly approximately 2.5 million
            light-years (770 kiloparsecs) from Earth and the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way.The galaxy's name
            stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is
            named
            after the Ethiopian (or Phoenician) princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.

            The virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at 1
            trillion solar masses (2.0×1042 kilograms). The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any
            accuracy, but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy is more massive than the Milky Way by a margin
            of
            some 25% to 50%. This has been called into question by a 2018 study that cited a lower estimate on the mass
            of
            the Andromeda Galaxy, combined with preliminary reports on a 2019 study estimating a higher mass of the
            Milky Way.The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 220,000 ly (67 kpc), making it the largest
            member of the Local Group in terms of extension.

            The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in around 4-5 billion years, merging to form a
            giant elliptical galaxy or a large lenticular galaxy.With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda
            Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier objects, making it visible to the naked eye from Earth on
            moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.</p>

        <h5 class="heading"> THE CENTAURAS A GALAXY</h5>

        <br>
        <p class="font">Centaurus A (also known as NGC 5128 or Caldwell 77) is a galaxy in the constellation of
            Centaurus. It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta, in New
            South Wales, Australia. There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy's fundamental
            properties such as its Hubble type (lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy) and distance (10–16
            million light-years). NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth, so its active
            galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is also the
            fifth-brightest in the sky, making it an ideal amateur astronomy target. It is only visible from the
            southern hemisphere and low northern latitudes.

            The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 55 million solar masses,
            which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. By
            taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade, astronomers have determined that the inner parts
            of the jet are moving at about half of the speed of light. X-rays are produced farther out as the jet
            collides with surrounding gases, resulting in the creation of highly energetic particles. The X-ray jets of
            Centaurus A are thousands of light-years long, while the radio jets are over a million light-years long.

            As in other starburst galaxies, a galactic collision is suspected to be responsible for an intense burst of
            star formation. Models have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy that collided with a
            smaller spiral galaxy, with which it will eventually merge. For that reason, the galaxy has been of
            particular interest to astronomers for years. While collisions of spiral galaxies are relatively common, the
            effects of a collision between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy are not fully understood.</p>

        <p class="font">Messier 83 or M83, also known as the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy and NGC 5236, is a barred spiral
            galaxy approximately 15 million light-years away in the constellation borders of Hydra and Centaurus.
            Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered M83 on 23 February 1752 at the Cape of Good Hope. Charles Messier
            added it to his catalogue of nebulous objects (now known as the Messier Catalogue) in March 1781. It is
            one of the closest and brightest barred spiral galaxies in the sky, and is visible with binoculars. Its
            nickname of the Southern Pinwheel derives from its resemblance to the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101).</p>

        <p class="font">The Pinwheel Galaxy (also known as Messier 101, M101 or NGC 5457) is a face-on spiral galaxy 21
            million light-years (6.4
            megaparsecs) away from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781
            and was
            communicated that year to Charles Messier, who verified its position for inclusion in the Messier Catalogue
            as one of
            its final entries.

            On February 28, 2006, NASA and the European Space Agency released a very detailed image of the Pinwheel
            Galaxy, which
            was the largest and most-detailed image of a galaxy by Hubble Space Telescope at the time. The image was
            composed of
            51 individual exposures, plus some extra ground-based photos.

            On August 24, 2011, a Type Ia supernova, SN 2011fe, was discovered in M101.</p>
